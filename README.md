# ImPlot.jl
Plotting extension library that can be used in conjunction with 
[CImGui.jl](https://github.com/Gnimuc/CImGui.jl) to provide enhanced
immediate-mode data visualization.

ImPlot.jl provides an interface to [cimplot](https://github.com/cimgui/cimplot), 
which is an auto-generated C API to [implot](https://github.com/epezent/implot),
a C++ plotting extension library for [imgui](https://github.com/ocornut/imgui).

See the [docs](https://juliaimgui.github.io/ImGuiDocs.jl/implot/) for more
